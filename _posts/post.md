<h1>web developer tools<h>
The web Developer Tools (DevTools for short), are a set of web authoring and debugging tools built into Google Chrome. The DevTools provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application. Use the DevTools to efficiently track down layout issues, set JavaScript breakpoints, and get insights for code optimization. 
<h3>accessing the Dev Tools<h3>
To access the DevTools, open a web page or web app in Google Chrome. Either:
    *Select the Chrome menu at the top-right of your browser window, then select Tools > Developer Tools.
    *Right-click on any page element and select Inspect Element.
The DevTools window will open at the bottom of your Chrome browser.

**Inspecting the DOM and styles**
  The Elements panel lets you see everything in one DOM tree, and allows inspection and on-the-fly editing of DOM elements. You will often visit the Elements tabs when you need to identify the HTML snippet for some aspect of the page. For example, you may be curious if an image has an HTML id attribute and what the value is. 

**working with the console**
  The JavaScript Console provides two primary functions for developers testing web pages and applications. It is a place to:
    *Log diagnostic information in the development process.
    *A shell prompt which can be used to interact with the document and DevTools. 
  **Debugging javaScript**
  As the complexity of JavaScript applications increase, developers need powerful debugging tools to help quickly discover the cause of an issue and fix it efficiently. The Chrome DevTools include a number of useful tools to help make debugging JavaScript less painful. 
    **improving network performance**
  The Network panel provides insights into resources that are requested and downloaded over the network in real time. Identifying and addressing those requests taking longer than expected is an essential step in optimizing your page.  
    **Audits**
The Audit panel can analyze a page as it loads. Then provides suggestions and optimizations for decreasing page load time and increase perceived (and real) responsiveness. For further insight, we recommend using PageSpeed Insights. 
   **Improving rendering performance**
  The Timeline panel gives you a complete overview of where time is spent when loading and using your web app or page. All events, from loading resources to parsing JavaScript, calculating styles, and repainting are plotted on a timeline.
